**My Next.js Events App**

I created a project to practice how Next.js app routing works, as well as saving data to MongoDB. I also wanted to learn more about getStaticProps and how to use it to generate static pages, as well as how to use getStaticPaths to generate dynamic pages.

One of the things I'm most proud of about this project is that I was able to combine client-site data fetching with static generation. This means that my app can be both fast and dynamic, which is a great combination for an events app.

I also learned a lot about Next.js's routing system while working on this project. I was able to create a variety of different routes, including routes for individual events, a list of all events, and even a route for creating new events.

Overall, I'm really happy with how this project turned out. It was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Next.js and to practice my skills in building web applications.

Here are some of the specific things I learned while working on this project:

How to use Next.js's routing system to create different types of routes
How to use getStaticProps to generate static pages
How to use getStaticPaths to generate dynamic pages
How to combine client-site data fetching with static generation
How to save data to MongoDB from a Next.js app


I'm excited to continue learning more about Next.js and to build more complex and interesting applications with it in the future.
